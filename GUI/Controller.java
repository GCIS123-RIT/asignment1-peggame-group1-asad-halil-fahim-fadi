 * The controller is the component that enables the interconnection between the views and the model so it acts as an intermediary. 
 * The controller doesn’t have to worry about handling data logic, it just tells the model what to do. 
 * It processes all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulates data using the Model component, and interact with the View to render the final output.
